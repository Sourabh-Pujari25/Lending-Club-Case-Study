# Lending Club Case Study
    * Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

## Problem Statement
    * We have to identify the risky loan applicants, and avoid approving loans to defaulters and reduce financial loss for the company there by cutting down the amount of credit loss.
    * Company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
    * The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
